# HTML

## chapter 18

=======

Every website should be designed for the target audience, So you should know who the target audience is, Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming.

First, you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the fictional visitors you created in the step described on the previous page.

Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into Site Map.

Site Map

 

Wireframe

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

 

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

Designing Navigation

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.

HTML5 Layout

chapter 17

=======

HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

For a long time, web page authors used < div > elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer, or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the < div > element in the structure of the page.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors from using them already.

Headers & Footers

The < header > and < footer > elements can be used for:

The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

A header or footer for an individual < article > or < section > within the page.

the < header > element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The < footer > element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions.

Articles < article >

The < article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

Heading Groups < hgroup >

The purpose of the < hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more < h1> through < h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

  <footer>
